# -sleep-quality-analyzer

#Description
AI-Powered Sleep Quality Analyzer is a Python tool that uses machine learning to 
analyze nightlyaudio recordings and provide feedback on your sleep quality, helping
you detect snoring, coughing,and other sleep-related sounds.

#Features
->Audio-based sleep event detection (snoring, coughing, silence, etc.)
->Sleep quality scoring and daily reports
->Visualizations of sleep patterns
->Simple and user-friendly interface
->(Add any other features you plan)

#Explanation
In the waveform graph of the audio recording, the amplitude represents the intensity of sound over time.

->Flat Graph: If the waveform appears mostly flat with little variation, this indicates that the individual
likely experienced a peaceful nightâ€™s sleep, free from disturbances such as coughing or snoring. This suggests
a good quality of sleep, where the person remained undisturbed.

->Varying Graph: Conversely, if the graph shows significant fluctuations and peaks, this suggests the presence of 
sound events during the night, such as coughing or snoring. These variations indicate interruptions in sleep, 
which may negatively impact the quality of rest.
